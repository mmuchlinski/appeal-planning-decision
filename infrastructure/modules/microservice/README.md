# Microservice Module

A microservice is an isolated collection of resources, logically separated from
other resources.

A microservice consists of a resource group and N number of services. By
convention, there is an Azure Web App at the heart of it, with optional CosmosDB
and Blob Storage. Additional resources can be added outside of this module.
